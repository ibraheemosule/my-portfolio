                        <h5>REASON FOR CREATING THIS PROJECT</h5>
                            <p>This project was created with the aim of helping smartphone and desktop users make quick calculations as 
                           they go about their daily business. We make calculations in our every day lives although, the extrimity might
                        differ. Nevertheless, we still engage in it either consciously or subconsciously hence, I decided to add a little
                         more to this project by making it's UX easy to navigate and it's UI user friendly with the hope that it makes life easier for some individuals.</p> 

                        <h5>TOOLS REQUIRED</h5>
                        <p>CSS, HTML, javaScript, VS Code Editor, Git, Github, Netlify etc.</p>

                        <h5>CHALLENGES FACED</h5>
                        <p>This project marks my first task where I've had to use more of JS than HTML and CSS. The HTML did not give much difficulty as 
                            opposed to the CSS and JS with the latter proving to be the most challenging. I had issues on the most suitable layout to use so i tried using
                             the flex display since it's what I'm most comfortable with but I wasn't getting the grid view I needed so I had to revise Grid display and used
                              it for this project. 
                        </p>
                        <p> In the JS aspect, I had issues with the "=" and the "X<sup>n</sup>"  functionality. This prompted me to revise JS basics
                         which aided my brekthrough in this project. Link to the project can be found below.</p>

    <h4>A CHEETAH JUMP GAME</h4> <a href="#jumpGame" class="accordion-toggle">READ MORE <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></a>
    <div class="accordion-content" id="jumpGame">
        <h5>REASON FOR CREATING THIS PROJECT</h5>
            <p>As a youth, the memory of my teenage years are still very clear as day. Having little to do with so much time occupied by boredom is something
                that hunts lots of teenagers out there. This game was created as a remedy to solve this problem. It an interesting project, one that tested my 
                creative and cognitive thinking. It looks quite similar to the google chrome game but with a bit better UIUX/ experience.
            </p> 

        <h5>TOOLS REQUIRED</h5>
        <p>CSS, HTML, javaScript, VS Code Editor, Git, Github, Netlify etc.</p>

        <h5>CHALLENGES FACED</h5>
        <p> Before this project, I never knew what it's like to get lost in the DOM. With the help of this project, I got a first hand experience on how frustrating and problematic it can be. 
            There were lot of obstacles I had to jump in order to successfully complete this project <small>"pun definitely intended"</small>. I stumbled upon a glitch 
            which happens whenever the Character makes a jump. Took me 3 days to solve this when all that was required was just to use a simple return statement.
        </p>
        <p> For the character and Cheetah's movements, I used CSS transition to create a form of dynamism and perfect speed for both the jumping height of the character and the 
            cheetah's speed. Trust me, It's not as easy as it sounds. Link to the project can be found below.</p>

        <h4>A RECEIPT GENERATOR</h4> <a href="#receipt" class="accordion-toggle">READ MORE <i class="fa fa-caret-down"></i></a>

        <div class="accordion-content" id="receipt">
            <h5>REASON FOR CREATING THIS PROJECT</h5>
                <p> One thing a business personnel values is proof of transaction. With the ever growing business innovations and the daily buying and selling activities. Business
                     Enterprises such as supermarkets, grocery stores etc. needs an easy to use receipt generator tool to help them allocate proof of transactions. Hence, I embarked on this project to help create 
                     a solution to this issue.</p> 
    
            <h5>TOOLS REQUIRED</h5>
            <p>CSS, HTML, javaScript, VS Code Editor, Git, Github, Netlify etc.</p>
    
            <h5>CHALLENGES FACED</h5>
            <p> This project I find quite intruging as it exposed me to a lot of things in JS. Before, this project, I never knew how to print a html element content such as a div content.
                For the css, I used grid display as it was the most suitable for this kind of project. I had issues trying to sort the calculations and the table element that should
                 be printed out. Also, Since the values of an input tag are strings, I had to turn them to numbers using the <code>parseInt()</code> function.
            </p>
            <p> In conclusion, I had problems dealing with the DOM, but since I already possess adequate knowledge about the basics, I was able to solve the problems
                 thrown at me swiftly. Follow the link below to view the project.</p>

        <div class="accordion-content" id="todo">
            <h5>REASON FOR CREATING THIS PROJECT</h5>
                <p> Every successful developer once had a mentor or someone they looked up to. As a junior developer, mine is no different. This project was 
                    inspired by my mentor. He told in order to appreciate REACT, I need to do a to do list vanilla javaScript. Hence, I commenced on the project and 
                    in the end, I was quite pleased with the result of this project and I hope you are too.
                </p> 
                <p>In view of the above, I am opened to review, remark and suggestions. You can reach me at the contact page located at the nav section</p>
    
            <h5>TOOLS REQUIRED</h5>
            <p>CSS, HTML, javaScript, VS Code Editor, Git, Github, Netlify etc.</p>
    
            <h5>CHALLENGES FACED</h5>
            <p> This project made me learn more about the DOM. I had a major challenge in getting to highlight the checked options and move them to another section
                 in the page. Another challenge faced was coming up with a unique UI/UX thats quite easy to navigate through and also welcoming.</p>
            <p>Personally, I find CSS quite convenient to use than bootstrap, because it gives you total control of the changes in the styling of your code. So,
                 since this is the first project I ever used bootstrap with, I wasn't so comfortable using classes in every html tag I created. 
                 Hopefully, this will be just a one-time feeling. Follow the link below to view the project.</p>

                            <p> Well, what can I say? From our coding cradle stage of <code>console.log("Hello World");</code> to the level we are now, It gets
                                to a point where you decide it's time to put into practice what you learnt. This was the first project I did after completing my
                                HTML and CSS lessons. Although, I had gone back to reform this project so it looks slightly better that it once was. </p>

                        <h5>CHALLENGES FACED</h5>
                        <p> As at when I created created this page, I knew nothing about responsive design, the issues I had then was remembering to put the semi-colon 
                            at the end of my CSS stylings and trying of figure out which html code require closing tags. Looking back at those moments now, it was quite an 
                            experience. Follow the link below to view the project.

        <h5>CHALLENGES FACED</h5>
        <p> Initially, the finished project looked good on a devices with large viewports but since I didn't make the page responsive, 
            It looked awful on smaller devices. Hence, I had to return to make the page responsive and added the collapsible navbar to it using bootstrap.

        <h5>REASON FOR CREATING THIS PROJECT</h5>
            <p>I applied for a role of App Developer Intern a <a href="https://bincom.net">Bincom</a> where the successful applicants were tasked to create 
                a simple page that includes our resume without the use of bootstrap. I came up with this page and added an image slider to it just to 
            make it unique</p>

        <h5>CHALLENGES FACED</h5>
        <p> This was my first project that I had to use javaScript. Creating an image slider for the first time was a huge task for me then. Also, 
            I made the page responsive using mediaQuery, made the navbar collapsible and added a dropdown menu to the settings button. Follow the link

            <h5>CHALLENGES FACED</h5>
            <p> While working on this page, I had zero knowledge of bootstrap and mediaQuery and needed to make this page responsive. So I picked up mediaQuery 
                and used this project to learn, make mistakes and correct them. It was a good project to learn responsiveness with.
